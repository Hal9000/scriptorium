.dropcap It's been a while since I was there. They say it was torn down
while I wasn't looking. Never tagged anything there, of course, nor
anywhere else. Spraypainting public places isn't my thing, but in this
case I condoned it because it was sort of there for that purpose.

This fake entry is a long one so as to demonstrate both drop-caps
(above) and an inset quote. Blah blah blah. Lorem ipsum dolor and
a partridge in a pear tree.

Wherever you go, there you are. Last night I saw upon the stair
a little man who was not there. He wasn't there again today; I
wish, I wish he'd go away.  As far as we know, our computer has 
never had an undetected error.  
|On a clean disk, you can seek forever.
And never let it be denied that 
pobbles are happier without their toes. And may your snark never 
be a boojum. How do you know you aren't dreaming right now? When
you see a butterfly, think of Chuang Tzu.

mankind.

Pity this busy monster, manunkind, not. Pity rather... Listen:
There's a hell of a universe next door; let's go.
