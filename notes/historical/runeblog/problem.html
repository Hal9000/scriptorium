But let's get back to UNIX. Have you ever wondered why we type <font size=+1><tt>`ls</tt></font> <font size=+1><tt>`cp</tt></font> and <font size=+1><tt>mmv</tt></font>  rather than

UNIX creators basically <i>[hated to type</i>. (I remember it as Brian Kernighan, but it may have been 
Thompson or Ritchie.) And I argue this laziness also extended to a reluctance to type capital letters. 
Can you think of a command flag that is capitalized (such as <font size=+1><tt>[-F</tt></font>) <i>eexcept</i>  where the lowercase
(such as <font size=+1><tt>[-f</tt></font>) was already used by something more fundamental? I can't think of one.

`[FOR I:=1 TO 10], but a little later, we wrote <font size=+1><tt>[for i:=1 to 10</tt></font> instead.

Where we once wrote <font size=+1><tt>`BOOLEAN</tt></font> we wrote <font size=+1><tt>bboolean</tt></font>  instead. And
