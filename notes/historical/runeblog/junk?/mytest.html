<div style="padding-top: 1px">t's been quite
a while since I was there. They say it was torn down
while I wasn't looking. Never actually tagged anything there (or anywhere else for that matter).
But I'm just rambling here. I was born a rambling man, as the song said. Or as the other song
said, I was born under a wandering star.

This fake entry is a long one so as to demonstrate both drop-caps

As far as we know, our computer has never had an undetected error.
But that is what they all say. How do you know you're not dreaming
right now? When you see a butterfly, think of Chuang Tzu.
 On a clean disk, you can seek forever.
And never let it be denied that pobbles are happier without their
toes. And may your snark never be a boojum.

Contact light. Houston, this is Tranquility Base. The Eagle has
landed. That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for 
mankind.

Pity this busy monster, manunkind, not. Pity rather... Listen:
There's a hell of a universe next door; let's go.
