            <p>Today I have an unusual proposition for you. I’m spending a bunch of time to try to get Beto elected to Texas
              Senate, so I’ve not been able to write as much technical content. Rather than slow down on my door knocking,
              I’m looking to pick up the pace, and I want you to do it with me. Starting today, I’m offering anyone who
              phone banks or “block walks” (knocks on doors) the opportunity to win some of my technical time. Here’s how
              it’s going to work.</p>

            <p>Rails 5.2 was just released last month with a major new feature: Active Storage. Active Storage provides file
              uploads and attachments for Active Record models with a variety of backing services (like AWS S3). While
              libraries like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> exist to do similar work, this
              is the first time that such a feature has been shipped with Rails. At Heroku, we consider cloud storage a best
              practice, so we’ve ensured that it works on our platform. In this post, we’ll share how we prepared for the
              release of Rails 5.2, and how you can deploy an app today using the new Active Storage functionality.</p>

              had my second kid and it’s given me some time to think about the products that truly bring me joy versus those
              that are merely necessary. There’s plenty of baby product recommendation lists out there, this one is
              mine.</p>

            <p>After this holiday season many of us would like to lose a little weight, page weight that is. In my app <a
                href="https://www.codetriage.com">CodeTriage</a> I make extensive use of SVG elements for images, the logo,
              and icons. Until recently, I’ve been rendering the SVG elements directly in the HTML. This was the easiest
              thing to do. As you might guess by my intro sentence, I’ve been working on decreasing page weight by removing
              SVG elements from the HTML. How well did it work? Before making changes the homepage was 14kb (77kb unzipped).
              After the change, the homepage is 6kb (30kb unzipped). That’s a 57% reduction in “over the wire” bytes per
              page load. What exactly did I do, and what were the trade-offs I made to get to a smaller page? Let’s look at
              how I was previously using SVG.</p>

            <p>When I used my first ORM, I wondered “why didn’t they include a <code
            >random()</code> method?” It seemed like such an easy thing to add. While there are
              many reasons you may want to pull a record out of your database at random, you shouldn’t be using SQL’s
              <code>ORDER BY RANDOM()</code> unless you’ll only be randomizing a limited number of
              records. In this post, we’ll examine how such a simple looking SQL operator can cause a lot of performance
              pain, and a few different techniques we can use to fix it.</p>

            <p>Have you ever felt like a framework was getting in the way instead of helping you go faster? Maybe you’re
              stuck on some simple task that would be easy to do manually, but your framework is making you jump through
              configuration hoops. I end up getting lost in a sea of documentation (or no documentation), and the search for
              that one magical config key takes just a tad bit too long. It’s a productivity sink, and worse than the time
              delay it adds to my frustration throughout the day. When I hit <code >ETOOMUCHFRUSTRATION</code>,
              then I’m definitely fighting the framework. One way to alleviate this configuration fatigue is by making
              configuration consistent and composable. That’s what Sprocket’s new “manifest.js” seeks to do.</p>
