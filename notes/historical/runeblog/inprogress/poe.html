You probably have read some of the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. Many of us, for
better or worse, could name two or three from exposure to them in high school
English class.
<p>

But there are others that are read less commonly. There is one in particular
that I have always found moving and meaningful: the poem called "Alone."
<p>

So that you won't have to look it up, I have included it here. And I'm also doing
two things here that are fairly unconventional.
<p>

First of all, I'll reformat it so that it doesn't "look" so much like a poem
(or maybe more like a modern poem). I also change word order and remove some of 
the apostrophes that look odd to many of us. I don't favor the "dumbing down" of 
older writings, but the reformatting emphasizes the meaning (and may be easier 
and clearer for the modern reader). 
<p>

And then I take this a step further. I translate the poem into an actual diagram,
almost recalling the lost art of diagramming sentences. And finally, I will 
give you my own thoughts on the poem in the context of his "most stormy life."
<p>
