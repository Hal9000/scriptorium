Deploying/updating
------------------

x 1. Idea: Widgets are stored in gem; code is not necessarily copied over
     to a new view.

x 2. Therefore, widgets can be installed or updated.

x 3. The gem "knows" which widgets are available, so they can be put in
     the "available" list but not installed unless requested.

x 4. Where to store them in gem?

  5. repl: install WIDGET   (root -> view?)
           enable     "     (.txt file)
           disable    "     (.txt file)
           update     "     (gem -> root and view?)
     Version numbers for widgets?


Original notes
--------------

1.  Originally my concept of a "widget" was a self-contained item that would
    display in a box in the sidebar.

2.  Examples of widgets: 
      - pages (list of my own pages)
      - links (list of other sites/blogs that I recommend)
      - search (search for posts in title, body, tags, etc.)
      - bydates (browse posts by date in a calendar style)

2.  Then I started thinking: But these don't really differ from a sidebar item?
    So maybe I should generalize.

3.  Then I thought: But there are potentially different varieties of these and
    different behaviors (so I got confused).
 
4.  Example: A search box *could* live in the sidebar (opening results in the 
    main area)

5.  Or it could be a "Search" link in the navbar, opening the search box in the
    main area and overlaying it when it finds results.

6.  For that matter, any widget *could* just be a single link in the sidebar, 
    opening into the main area when it's clicked.

7.  Similarly, I notice that "Recent News" only displays a few news items. 
    Maybe clicking the actual header should open the full list in the main area?

8.  Also: The sidebar items themselves (which work) are confusing to me. There has
    to be some templating and some logic, and when I try to separate those out, I
    find myself screwing up.

9.  Re confusing sidebar -- I recommend doing things like this to see what is 
    going on:
      $ vi -O themes/standard/sidebar/news.lt3       lib/liveblog.rb  .blogs/views/around_austin/remote/index.html
      $ vi -O themes/standard/sidebar/tag-cloud.lt3  lib/liveblog.rb  .blogs/views/around_austin/remote/index.html
      $ vi -O themes/standard/sidebar/calendar.lt3   lib/liveblog.rb  .blogs/views/around_austin/remote/index.html
