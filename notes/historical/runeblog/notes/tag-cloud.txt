The command .tags specifies any/all tags for a post
When a draft is processed, the tags will be collected
Backend Idea: 
  - somewhere there is a "tags" directory
  - each file in it is named for a tag
  - each file has a list of drafts (uniq'd in case of reprocessing)
Frontend: Who knows??
  - reads all the tag files
  - turns into magic HTML (see tag-cloud mockup)
