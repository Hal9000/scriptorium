** Thinking about assets...

Search as far up the tree as necessary?
Copy to server? Or also to local dir?

Why do we even track assets? 
 - So they can be uploaded to the remote server as needed.
 - ? So they can be moved to optimum point of use?
Remember to update "src=" properly.
First order simplification:
  - .image copies into assets?
  - should worry about filenames overwritten
  - dump all into view/assets
  - let .image be aware of view/assets
  - HTML should say src=assets/...
  - publish dumps all needed assets (looking at checksums? Or just published list?)
  - how to handle in repl?


** Thinking about templates...

Should there be global templates? Maybe with
  more than one view specified?
Should there be a default template per view?
Always select view when starting post? Unless there
  is only one to choose?
Or select a template, then start a post?
Templates are part of "config" menu??
