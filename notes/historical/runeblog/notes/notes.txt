templates...
------------
To post: 
  - ask title
  - multiselect views
  - multiselect tags?

config command (?)
--------------
edit .blogs/config? view/publish
edit view/templates/*
ssh keys??


Creating a view:
----------------
*Ideally: enter deployment info up front
Copy default files over (header, trailer, template)
These "should" have vars referring to server/etc. (for Back/Home)
Can't deploy with deployment info
What about rebuild??
Make a View class?


Work flow: Make a post, publish it
----------

Publishing involves:
  - process text
  - push into views
  - link into blog history
  - scp to server (call that deploy now?)


features:
  - youtube
  - gist
  - wikipedia?
  - render inset quote as graphics?

Logic flow
----------

Post
----
Create a blog post
Process it
Link it
Upload to server

Edit (name)
----
Edit
Process
Redeploy

Delete (name)
------
Mark deleted
Relink
Redeploy


Issues:
-------
Leftover junk files?
How form slug?
How delete files?
How embed images, links, etc.?
