.h3 Runeblog: Notes for collaborators

Runeblog is one of my very favorite projects. No one uses it but me.

At some point, I let the code get out of control. Worse than that, the
code no longer works with my existing blog installation.

Existing blog: $$link[Ruby, Elixir, and more|https://rubyhacker.com/rubyelixiretc/]
<br>
Another blog: $$link[Around Austin|https://rubyhacker.com/around_austin/] (mostly for testing)

Main repo: $$link[Runeblog|https://github.com/Hal9000/runeblog]
<br>
Also used: $$link[Livetext|//github.com/Hal9000/livetext] and 
           $$link[RubyText|https://github.com/Hal9000/rubytext]

My goals:
.nlist
Get the code working again
Make sure it is compatible with existing legacy data
Refactor and improve
Add tests
.end

I'd love to have people to pair with on this. I'm thinking remote pairing
with Zoom or whatever, probably with me driving.

I am willing (planning) to do major refactoring and redesign. But whatever
we do has to fit into my overall goal.

General guidelines:
.nlist
This tool is based on Livetext (my own tool) and will continue that way. However, I am willing to add fixes and enhancements and improvements.
This is a tool that generates static content. In general, this will not change. If someone has suggestions for simple ways to add pieces of dynamic content, I'll consider it.
The blogger's interface is text-based via my own RubyText which is built on curses and the curses gem. I am flexible on details, but the interface itself will NOT be web-based.
I do want to add a simple non-interactive command line interface (which could be invoked in scripts if necessary).  
The overall philosophy of this tool will not change. However, I am certainly open to changing many issues with deployed data, including file names, file contents, directory structures, and so on. 
I am also willing to consider changes in the code structure, the class hierarchy, the API, the names of classes/variables/methods, the Livetext interface, and so on.
