I want to create a new widget. This one may or may not inherit from ListWidget 
as the other two do.

Let's call it "featured" with the title "Featured Posts" -- the idea is that
some blog posts in this view are "special" or important.

I am uncertain how to mark these. I used to use a Livetext dot command to 
mark these. I am still ok with that (ex: .featured) but I wonder whether there
should be another way (after post creation) to mark these?
