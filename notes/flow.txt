Assume that wizard_new_view will be called as soon as the repo has been created 
(IF the sample view is the only one).

So the wizard will do this:
- create_view
- ask user if he wants to edit the layout
    - y: edit_file("..../layout.txt")
    - n: just leave the initial one
- now layout is a list of containers (e.g., header, main, right)
- for each of these:
     - want to configure <container>?
         - y: edit_file(whatever)
         - n: just leave as-is

Now the detail of that works sort of like this:
  - header (edit view/config/header.txt or skip)
  - main (just a stub for now)
  - left, right (add widget(s)? or skip) -- see below
  - footer (no real config for now)

Widgets:
   - show available widgets
   - let user pick (hmm, how to select?)
   - now we have a list of widgets

  For each widget:
    - do you want to configure?
        - y: config for widget
        - n: just leave as-is

   What config means:
       Links: want to edit the list of links?
       Pages:  edit the list of pages?

   If user adds pages, they may not exist.

So for Pages, if a user adds pages, we have a list of pages.
For each one nonexistent: do you want to edit <whatever>?

Does this all make sense? I know it's complex.

Ask any questions.
