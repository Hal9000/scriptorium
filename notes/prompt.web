I want to create a web-based tool that works in essence the same as the TUI. 
Constraints follow:

0. Let's develop incrementally. Ask me clarifying questions and seek feedback.

1. Use webrick as needed. Try to track whether it is running, and be able to
kill it and restart it.

2. Use Sinatra

3. Keep the file-based data storage; there will be no database.

4. Avoid extra installations if possible.

5. Add tests as we go, if possible. I believe web testing is problematic.

6. At a conceptual level, follow the flow of the TUI and use the calls we 
have available in the API.

7. For edit_file, I suggest a simple textarea (unless you have a better idea).
