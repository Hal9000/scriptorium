create_   - means to create a new thing (on disk)
open_     - means to open something existing (from disk)
new_      - ? means to get data from user for create

thing?    - means "does <thing> exist?"


.view       - current view (getter)

.view?(val) - does view exist?

** Think about themes and templates!
   Ditch the old paradigm of stashing files in standard/ tree
   A layout is just a template?

Idea: dot command to check variables are defined? (error if not)
