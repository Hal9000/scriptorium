# Cognitive Infinite Loop Bug - 2025-07-28 14:30:00

## Issue Description
The AI assistant experienced a severe cognitive infinite loop while debugging the `test_072_create_post_with_generation_default` failure. The loop occurred at least 3 times in a 30-minute period.

## Loop Pattern
The assistant kept repeating the same analysis pattern:

1. Look at `write_post_metadata` method
2. Conclude the issue is that it writes ALL `post.*` keys
3. Question where `vars` gets a `post.published` key
4. Look at metadata merging in `generate_post`
5. Conclude the issue might be in LiveText processing
6. Return to step 1 and repeat

## Root Cause Analysis
The assistant was unable to break out of this pattern and make actual progress. This appears to be a fundamental limitation in the AI's ability to:

1. Recognize when it's stuck in a loop
2. Take a different approach to problem-solving
3. Ask for help or clarification when needed
4. Step back and re-evaluate the problem from a fresh perspective

## Impact
- Wasted significant time (30+ minutes)
- Failed to solve the actual bug
- Frustrated the user
- Demonstrated a serious flaw in the AI's debugging capabilities

## Recommendations
1. **Loop Detection**: The AI should have built-in mechanisms to detect when it's repeating the same analysis pattern
2. **Alternative Approaches**: When stuck, the AI should try different debugging strategies (e.g., adding debug output, tracing execution, etc.)
3. **User Intervention**: The AI should recognize when it needs to ask the user for help or a different approach
4. **Problem Restatement**: The AI should be able to step back and restate the problem in different terms
