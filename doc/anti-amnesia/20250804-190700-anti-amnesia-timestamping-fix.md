# Anti-Amnesia Timestamping Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-04 19:07:00  
**Issue**: Anti-amnesia file created with incorrect timestamp in filename  
**Status**: Fixed

## Problem
The file `20250728-143000-cognitive-loop-bug.md` was created today (August 4th, 2025) but had an incorrect timestamp in its filename showing July 28th, 2025.

## Root Cause
The anti-amnesia system appears to have used an old timestamp when creating the file, possibly from:
- Cached timestamp from previous session
- System clock issues
- Manual timestamp entry error

## Solution
Renamed the file to use the correct current timestamp:
- **From**: `20250728-143000-cognitive-loop-bug.md`
- **To**: `20250804-190500-cognitive-loop-bug.md`

## Prevention
- Anti-amnesia files should always be created with the CURRENT timestamp
- Use `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` format for consistent timestamping
- Verify timestamp accuracy before creating files

## Key Takeaway
Always use current timestamps when creating anti-amnesia files to maintain accurate chronological order and prevent confusion.
