**USER:** 
There is a mysterious issue apparently related to how Cursor loads a shell. The Ruby version is 2.6.1 rather than 3.2.3 -- the fix is something to do with rbenv? When you find it again, document to anti-amnesia.

**ASST:** 
## Cursor rbenv Ruby Version Mystery - SOLVED

### The Problem
- **Cursor was loading Ruby 2.6.10** instead of the expected 3.2.3
- **Tests were failing** with `cannot load such file -- livetext (LoadError)`
- **System Ruby was being used** (`/usr/bin/ruby`) instead of rbenv-managed Ruby
- **Project has `.ruby-version` file** specifying 3.2.3

### Root Cause
- **rbenv shell integration was not enabled** in the Cursor terminal
- **PATH included rbenv shims** but rbenv wasn't properly initialized
- **Cursor's shell environment** wasn't loading rbenv initialization

### The Solution
```bash
# Enable rbenv shell integration
eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"

# Verify Ruby version is now correct
ruby --version  # Shows ruby 3.2.3
```

### Investigation Steps
1. **Checked Ruby version**: `ruby --version` showed 2.6.10
2. **Checked Ruby location**: `which ruby` showed `/usr/bin/ruby` (system)
3. **Checked PATH**: rbenv shims were in PATH but not working
4. **Checked rbenv versions**: `rbenv versions` showed 3.2.3 as current
5. **Checked .ruby-version**: File correctly specified 3.2.3
6. **Tried rbenv shell**: Failed with "shell integration not enabled"
7. **Enabled rbenv**: `eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"` fixed the issue

### Key Insights
- **rbenv requires shell integration** to work properly
- **Cursor terminals may not inherit** rbenv initialization from shell config
- **The fix is temporary** - needs to be done each time Cursor opens a new terminal
- **Permanent fix** would be to ensure rbenv init is in shell startup files

### After Fix
- **Ruby version**: Now correctly shows 3.2.3
- **Tests can load**: livetext gem dependency resolved
- **New issue discovered**: Syntax error in `temp_smart_concatenated_test.rb`

### Test Results After Fix
- **Core unit tests**: ✅ All passing (82 runs, 113 assertions)
- **Repo unit tests**: ✅ All passing (20 runs, 59 assertions)  
- **View unit tests**: ✅ All passing (25 runs, 43 assertions)
- **Post unit tests**: ✅ All passing (36 runs, 45 assertions)
- **Total core tests**: ✅ 163 runs, 260 assertions, 0 failures

### Remaining Issues
- **test_experimental.rb**: Has duplicate method extraction causing syntax errors
- **temp_smart_concatenated_test.rb**: Generated file has duplicate `test_stats_command` methods
- **test/all script**: Fails due to experimental test file issues

### Next Steps
- Fix test_experimental.rb duplicate method extraction
- Consider permanent rbenv integration for Cursor
- Run full test suite once experimental issues are resolved
