What Should Be Global in <head>?
Global <head> information typically includes things that apply to the entire site, such as:

CSS/JS Includes:

The Bootstrap CDN, for example, would be global since you likely want the same styling for the entire site.

Any other site-wide stylesheets or scripts that should be included on every page (e.g., a site-wide JS library).

Meta Tags:

Viewport meta tags to ensure responsive design. This could be global for consistency.

Any global robots meta tags or analytics tags (like Google Analytics or other site-wide integrations) would go here.

Favicon (optional):

If your site uses a specific favicon, you’d want to specify this globally.

==============

Certainly! Here's a "nice default" for the essential <head> elements (1, 2, 3, 4, and 8) that you can use for your project:

html
Copy
<head>
  <!-- Meta charset for character encoding -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

  <!-- Viewport meta tag for responsive design -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  <!-- Meta description for SEO -->
  <meta name="description" content="A blog for insightful content on various topics.">

  <!-- Robots meta tag to control search engine indexing -->
  <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">

  <!-- Link to Bootstrap CDN for styling -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-KyZXEJ04F5o1v7V5b7ZMjGhGjxA8yQmBfvZwzI1r+0gEv+9KnQIMJxWwzD0u8nZ7" crossorigin="anonymous">

  <!-- Title of the page (can be dynamically generated) -->
  <title>My Awesome Blog</title>
</head>
Explanation:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Defines the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which supports most characters and symbols.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is mobile-responsive by setting the viewport to match the device width and an initial zoom level of 1.

<meta name="description" content="...">: Provides a brief description of the page content for search engines and social media. This is often displayed in search results or link previews.

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">: Tells search engines to index the page and follow links on the page. You can modify this if you want to restrict search engines from indexing or following links.

<link href="...">: Links to the Bootstrap CSS from a CDN. This adds Bootstrap styles to your site. (Later, you can also link to your own CSS or other resources.)

<title>: Specifies the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab or window.


----------------------------
may be overridden by view:

For a given view, the pieces in the <head> section that are most likely to be overridden are those that might vary based on the specific content or focus of the view. These would include:

1. <title>
Reason: Each view may have a different title depending on the context, such as the name of the blog, the specific view, or the individual post.

Example: A blog view may have the title "My Awesome Blog", whereas a specific post may override it to show the post title, e.g., "My Awesome Blog - The Best Post Ever".

html
Copy
<title><%= @title %> - <%= @post_title %></title>
2. <meta name="description">
Reason: The description can change depending on the content of the view. A homepage might have a general description, while a specific post may have a description tailored to that post.

Example: The description of the homepage might be a brief tagline for the blog, while the post view would include a summary of the post content.

html
Copy
<meta name="description" content="<%= @description %>">
3. <meta name="robots">
Reason: You might want different indexing behavior for certain views. For example, you might want to prevent search engines from indexing a draft post or have a special rule for archives or tag pages.

Example: You can allow indexing for main content but no indexing for a draft page or non-public content.

html
Copy
<meta name="robots" content="<%= @robots_content %>">
4. <link href="..."> (CSS/JS CDN or Local Resources)
Reason: Some views may require a different theme or custom CSS/JS files. You may choose to override the Bootstrap link or add additional resources specific to that view.

Example: A specific view might require additional styles or scripts that are different from the default ones.

html
Copy
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= @css_link %>">
5. Custom Meta Tags for Social Media
Reason: For specific views or posts, social media meta tags (e.g., Open Graph tags for Facebook, Twitter cards) may need to be overridden to provide customized previews on social platforms.

Example: A post may have a different image or description when shared, compared to the default homepage view.

html
Copy
<meta property="og:title" content="<%= @og_title %>">
<meta property="og:description" content="<%= @og_description %>">
<meta property="og:image" content="<%= @og_image %>">
6. Favicon or Other Icon Links
Reason: Some views or posts may have specific icons, while the main site might have a general favicon.

Example: A blog's homepage may have one favicon, while a post could have a unique icon for a specific theme or feature.

html
Copy
<link rel="icon" href="<%= @favicon %>" type="image/x-icon">
To Summarize:
The most likely candidates for being overridden by the view include:

Title

Description (meta tag)

Robots (meta tag)

CSS/JS Resources

Social Media meta tags (e.g., Open Graph)

Favicon or custom icon links

These are the pieces of the <head> section that can be customized for individual views or specific content.

---------------------

Handling the Merge in Code
Here’s how you might structure the merge in your code:

Start with the global settings (which could be loaded from a global_head.txt or similar file).

Override with view-specific settings: When generating the <head>, check if there’s a view-specific setting. If it exists, use it to replace the global setting.

For example:

ruby
Copy
def generate_head
  head_content = ""

  # Start with global settings
  head_content << global_head_content

  # Check for view-specific overrides and replace or append
  head_content << "<title>#{@view_title || 'Default Title'}</title>"
  head_content << "<meta name='description' content='#{@view_description || 'Default description'}'>"
  head_content << "<meta name='robots' content='#{@view_robots || 'index, follow'}'>"

  # Append CSS/JS links, either replace or add more
  head_content << "<link rel='stylesheet' href='#{@view_css || 'default.css'}'>"

  # Handle Open Graph and Twitter meta tags
  head_content << "<meta property='og:title' content='#{@view_og_title || 'My Blog'}'>"

  # Append favicon if available
  head_content << "<link rel='icon' href='#{@view_favicon || 'default_favicon.ico'}'>"

  head_content
end
Summary
For titles, meta tags, and favicons, you can replace the global content with view-specific settings.

For CSS/JS files and social media tags, you can either replace the global ones or append additional ones.

Fallbacks should be used for missing view-specific settings, with defaults coming from the global setup.

The important thing here is that the view-specific settings should replace global defaults, but in some cases (like CSS/JS or social media tags), you may choose to append rather than fully replace.
